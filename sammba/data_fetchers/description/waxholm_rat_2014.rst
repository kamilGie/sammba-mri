WAXHOLM RAT


Notes
-----
The Waxholm Rat atlas is an open access volumetric atlas of the Sprague Dawley
rat brain. The is based on high resolution isotropic ex vivo T2* weighted MRI
and DTI data, acquired at the Duke Center for In Vivo Microscopy at resolutions
of 39 μm and 78 μm, respectively. The specimen is an 80 day old male Sprague
Dawley rat.

Anatomical delineations in the atlas are based on image contrast, described
in detail in the accompanying publications (Papp et al. 2014, Kjonigsen et al.
2015). The latest version of the atlas contains 79 structures, and is intended
as a basis for further partitioning by researchers in the community. We have
anchored the atlas to both Waxholm Space and the stereotaxic space.
