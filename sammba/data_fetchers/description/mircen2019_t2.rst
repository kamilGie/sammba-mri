MIRCEN 2019 T2


Notes
-----
34 mouse lemurs (22 males), young to middle-aged adults (mean age 36.8 months,
standard deviation 9.2 months) were scanned in vivo with a 7 Tesla  Agilent
system using a four channel phased-array surface coil.
The sequence was a 2D T2-weighted fast spin echo with a resolution of
230x230x230 µm, TR/TE = 10000/17.4 msec, RARE factor = 4,
field of view = 29.44 × 29.44 mm, matrix = 128 × 128, 128 slices,
number of averages = 6, acquisition duration 32 mins.
