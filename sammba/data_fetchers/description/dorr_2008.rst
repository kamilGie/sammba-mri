DORR


Notes
-----
A three-dimensional atlas of the mouse brain, manually segmented into 62
structures, based on an average of 32 mum isotropic resolution T(2)-weighted,
within skull images of forty 12 week old C57Bl/6J mice, scanned on a 7 T
scanner. Individual scans were normalized, registered, and averaged into one
volume. Structures within the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem were painted
on each slice of the average MR image while using simultaneous viewing
of the coronal, sagittal and horizontal orientations.
